# OpenMRS Manual Testing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **manual testing of the OpenMRS 2.x Demo application**, an open-source electronic medical record (EMR) platform used in healthcare environments. The purpose of this project was to verify that key patient management and system functionalities work as expected, while ensuring proper usability and data handling across different workflows.

All testing was performed manually on the **OpenMRS Demo site**, and documentation was maintained in an Excel workbook.
